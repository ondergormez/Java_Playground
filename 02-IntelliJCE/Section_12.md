# Working with Maven

## Creating Maven Projects
* Maven Archetype provides a handy way for dependency management.
* If you want you can select "org.apache.maven.archetypes:maven-archetype-quickstart" for quick start.

## Working with Existing Projects
* You just need to push the pom.xml file to the git repository.
* .iml file, .idea and target folder created after build the project.
